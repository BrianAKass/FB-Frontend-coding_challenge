# FirstBase Coding Challenge Entry

Written in ReactTS, @apollo/client, and GraphQL

## Installation.

### `Create a folder you wish to save the files to.`

This project contains my react app as well as the backend repository I downloaded at the time of the interview. The current backend may have been updated since then.

### `Open a bash compliant terminal of your choosing to the file location`

### `git clone the url`

    git clone

### `install backend and run it`

    cd/frontend-coding-challenge
    npm install
    npm run start

### `open another terminal ton install and run the frontend react app`

    cd/react-ts-app
    npm install
    npm run start

## Additional Notes:

#

Search Bar searches names (title, first and last) as well as the email field. if for example you search "Mr" and 'Mrs' still shows up thats giving you the email! Which can be copied the the clipboard at the push of a button! This was my first time using GQL/Apollo and I can see the appeal. Hope you enjoy this little project.
